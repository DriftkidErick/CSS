            <p>My name is <strong>Erick J Cordon</strong> and I am currently 22 years old. I am currently a <u>Software Engineering</u> student at New England Technical Institue of Technology. Since highschool I've had a little niche for coding and started learning some small code through code academy. I am hoping to become a full stack developer once I graduate.</p>

            <p>A little about me is I am an avid car enthusiast, I've been into cars since I was a young kid and currently hope to one day build one of my dream cars (an E36 BMW M3 or a Type R Civic). I'm also very into music Im super open minded to new music but my current favorite artist is <b>MF DOOM</b> with my favorite song being either "Rapp Snitch Kinishes" or "DOOMSDAY".  </p>
