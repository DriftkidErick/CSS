                <p>My name is Erick J Cordon and I am currently 22 years old. I am currently a Software Engineering student at New England Technical Institue of Technology. Since highschool I've had a little niche for coding and started learning some small code through code academy and FreeCodeCamp. I am hoping to become a front-end developer once I graduate.</p>

                <p>A little about me is I am an avid car enthusiast, I've been into cars since I was a young kid and currently hope to one day build one of my dream cars (an E36 BMW M3 üèéÔ∏è or a Type R Civic). I'm also very into music Im super open minded to new music but my current favorite artist is MF DOOM with my favorite song being either "Rapp Snitch Kinishes" or "DOOMSDAY". I also do some sim-racing on my free time in hopes to one day participate in time-attack racing.</p>
